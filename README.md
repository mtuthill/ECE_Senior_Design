https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio Link for GPIO Library Used

To run UI on Windows:
-I am using a WSL running Ubuntu
On the WSL:
-Had to install PyQt5 using sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 
-Had to install gnuplot-nox using sudo apt install gnuplot-nox
-Had to install gnuplot-qt using sudo apt install gnuplot-qt

On my Windows OS:
-Had to download Xming X Server for Windows using the link below
https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/

After that, should be able to run UI and see it show up in a Xming window
