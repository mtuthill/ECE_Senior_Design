<br/>
To run UI on Windows: <br/>
I am using a WSL running Ubuntu <br/>
<br/>
On the WSL: <br/>
Had to install PyQt5 using sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 <br/>
Had to install gnuplot-nox using sudo apt install gnuplot-nox <br/>
Had to install gnuplot-qt using sudo apt install gnuplot-qt <br/>
<br/>
On my Windows OS:<br/>
Had to download Xming X Server for Windows using the link below <br/>
https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/ <br/>
<br/>
After that, should be able to run UI and see it show up in a Xming window<br/>
